# Using Oauth with Passport

Find a way to create a developer account to create the application id and client id

You have to get the three thing

- Client Secret
- Client ID
- Redirect

Then we can go ahead to install the neccessary package

```bash
npm install passport-google-oauth20
```

You may need to create a table in the database for the Oauth user

You need to activate the passport. The code is in the base `index.ts`

```index.ts
import session from "express-session"
import passport from "passport"

app.use(session(sessionobject))
app.use(passport.initialize())
app.use(passport.session()) //attach a user to req object
```

Then create the strategy for the oauth you plan to use

- The google strategy file

```googleStrategy.ts
```
