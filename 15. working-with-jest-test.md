# Working with Jest and Typescript

Jest is created by Facebook and can be used to test both frontend and backend

```bash
npm install -D jest @types/jest ts-jest
```

Then run the code below to create jest config file

```bash
npx ts-jest config:init
```

In the script at the package.json, put the test script there

```bash
"test": "jest",
```

You will create a folder in `src` and call it `__test__`. Then you may now create individual files in it.
