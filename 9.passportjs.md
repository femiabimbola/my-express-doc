# Working with Passport for Auth

You do not need a database for authentication

You may start by installing passport

```
npm i passport passport-local
``` 
It is <b>strongly recommended </b> to use passport with express session. Passport does the work of mapping a user to the session.

It is a middleware, it should be enabled after the session and before the routes

```index.ts
import session from "express-session"
import passport from "passport"

app.use(session(sessionobject))
app.use(passport.initialize)
```
