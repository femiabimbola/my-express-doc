# Using Session Store

It make sense to have session store in the database. For some unknown reason, a server may go down. Without session store in the databse, all the user will be logged out, which does not make any sense. Express session has to be in memory.

```bash
npm i connect-mongo
```

Add store in the session object. `express-session` is a prequiste

```index.ts
import MongoStore from 'connect-mongo'

const sessionObject = {
  secret: "some tough secret",
  saveUninitialized: false, //saving useless session
  resave: false, // Increases the expiration date when logged in
  cookie: { maxAge: 6000 * 60,}
  store: MongoStore.create({
    client:mongoose.connection.getClient()}
  ) // added because of the database
}

app.use(session(sessionObject))
```
